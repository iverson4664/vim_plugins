===========================================================
Note: Twitter no longer supports Basic authentication. You must use TwitVim version 0.5.0 or later. TwitVim 0.4.x will continue to work with identi.ca which still supports Basic authentication.

TwitVim OAuth support requires either the openssl software (See http://www.openssl.org/ ) or a Vim binary compiled with Perl, Python, Ruby, or Tcl. See :help TwitVim-install for more details.
===========================================================

TwitVim is a Vim plugin that allows you to post to Twitter and view Twitter timelines. It is an enhancement of vimscript #2124 by Travis Jeffery. Credit goes to Travis for the original script concept and implementation.

TwitVim supports most of the features of a typical Twitter client, including:
 - Friends, User, Direct Message, and Mentions timelines
 - Twitter Search
 - Replies and retweets
 - Hashtags (jump to search timeline)
 - In reply to (See which tweet an @-reply is for.)
 - Opening links in a browser
 - User profile display
 - Twitter Lists
 - URL shortening and expansion

TwitVim uses cURL to communicate with Twitter. Alternatively, you can configure TwitVim to use Vim's Perl, Python, Ruby, or Tcl interfaces for faster network I/O.

Usage:

:PosttoTwitter - This command will prompt you for a message to send to Twitter.
:CPosttoTwitter - This command posts the current line in the current buffer to Twitter.
:BPosttoTwitter - This command posts the current buffer to Twitter.

Alt-T - In Visual select mode, the Alt-T key posts the selected text to Twitter.
  (use Ctrl-T instead if menu bar is enabled)
NOTE: The T mapping was changed to Alt-T to avoid overriding the T search command.
