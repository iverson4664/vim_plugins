1. Commands                         *:Blogit* *blogit-commands*


:Blogit ls                          *:Blogit-ls*
        List all articles in the blog.

:Blogit new                         *:Blogit-new*
        Open buffer to write new article.

:Blogit this                        *:Blogit-this*
        Create blog post from current buffer.

:Blogit edit {id}                   *:Blogit-edit*
        Open the post {id} for edition.

:Blogit page {id}                   *:Blogit-page*
        Open the page {id} for edition.  If {id} is 'new' or 'this', it behaves
        like those commands for posts.  An example of a common page is the
        about page.

:Blogit commit                      *:Blogit-commit*
        Save or update the article to the blog.

:Blogit push                        *:Blogit-push*
        Publish article.

:Blogit unpush                      *:Blogit-unpush*
        Unpublish article (save as draft).

:Blogit rm {id}                     *:Blogit-rm*
        Remove an article.

:Blogit tags                        *:Blogit-tags*
        Show tags and categories list.

:Blogit preview                     *:Blogit-preview*
        Preview article in browser.

:Blogit help                        *:Blogit-help*
        Display help.

Note that preview might not work on all platforms. This is because we have
to rely on unsupported and non-portable functionality from the python
standard library.

2. Configuration                    *blogit-configuration*

Create a file called passwords.vim somewhere in your $VIMRUNTIME
(preferred location is "~/.vim/"). Don't forget to set the permissions so
only you can read it. This file should include:
>
    let blogit_username="Your blog user name"
    let blogit_password="Your blog password. Not the API-key."
    let blogit_url="https://your.path.to/xmlrpc.php"
<
In addition you can set these settings in your vimrc:
>
    let blogit_unformat="pandoc --from=html --to=rst --reference-links"
    let blogit_format="pandoc --from=rst --to=html --no-wrap"
<
The blogit_format and blogit_unformat each contain a shell command to filter
the blog entry text (no meta data) before a commit and after an edit,
respectively. In the example we use pandoc (see:|pandoc-url|) to edit the blog
in reStructuredText (see: |rst-url|).

If you have multible blogs replace "blogit" in "blogit_username" etc. by a
name of your choice (e.g. "your_blog_name") and use:
>
    let blog_name="your_blog_name"
<
to switch which is used by default. If a blog post/comment/list is open in
the current buffer that is used instead. To explicitly select which blog
should be used with the commands ls, new, this and edit add your_blog_name
as an aditional argument, e.g.:
>
    Blogit edit 42 your_blog_name
<

==============================================================================
3. Usage                            *blogit-usage*

Just fill in the blanks, do not modify the highlighted parts and everything
should be ok.

gf or <enter> in the |:Blogit-ls| buffer edits the blog post in the
current line.

Categories and tags can be omni completed via |compl-function| (usually
CTRL-X_CTRL-U). The list is automatically fetched with the first
":Blogit edit" and can be updated with ":Blogit tags".

To use tags your WordPress needs to have the UTW-RPC (see: |UTWRPC-url|)
plugin installed (WordPress.com does).
