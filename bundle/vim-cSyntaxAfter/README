This plugin was initially created for codeblock_dark color theme (vimscript #3266) to highlight operators (+ - / * = <> () and others) in C-like languages. Why it's needed? Well, by default vim doesn't do that. After switching from Code::Block to vim I got really missed it.

Then the plugin grew into something bigger. I started to use it to unify overal syntax highlighting for C-like languages.

It's possible to extend the plugin tu support other C-like languages (Java, Go etc).
For example for Object-C first check you don't have "objc" in autocmd in vimrc.
Then create new objc.vim file in <cSyntaxAfter_path>/after/syntax/ and add:

    if exists("*CSyntaxAfter")
       call CSyntaxAfter()
    endif

Then add new rules to syntax highligting, for example to highlight [ ] brackets
as operator and not constant add:

    syntax match _Operator display "[\[\]]"
    hi link _Operator Operator
