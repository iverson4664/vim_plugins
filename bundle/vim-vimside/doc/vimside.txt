==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                               *vimside-intro*

{Vimside} is a Vim Scala IDE. It uses Ensime as its backend compilation
and information server. As such, it shares capabilities with Ensime's
Emacs frontend. It was inspired by Daniel Spiewak talk about his JEdit 
binding to Ensime and by the existing Vim-Ensime python-enabled client Envim.
Vimside does have a couple of external dependencies beyond Ensime;
specifically, {Vimproc} and {Vimshell} and the optional {Self} and {Forms} Vim
libraries.

There are two ways to get Vimside and its dependencies onto one's 
machine: download the zip files for all required Vim scripts or
use a Vim plugin manager and configure it in one's '.vimrc' and it
will automatically download and install all of the files.
In either case, there is a little more work that needs to be done.
Vimproc is a VimL binding to a C-language library which provides the
socket support for Vimside to communicate with the Ensime Server.
This C-code must be compiled using one of the Vimproc provided
platform-specific make files. Also, Ensime, which is written in Scala,
must either be compiled (which is something I've never done) or one
simply downloads from the Ensime github site the pre-build library
which for either Scala 2.9.2 or 2.10-snapshot.

Prior to starting, a user must create some configuration files in order 
to use Vimside while editing their Scala project's code. One of the files 
is the Ensime configuration file which Vimside forwards to the Ensime 
Server and the others are optional and are used to configure Vimside.

Vimside comes with a test Java/Scale project with pre-configure
Ensime configuration file. These are located in the directory 'data/vimside'.
If one uses this Ensime configuration file and, in addition, creates
a tailored options_user,vim file in the same directory, one can
test out Vimside without having to try it on 'real' project code.

The Emacs Ensime client communicates with its backend Ensime server
using what is known as the Swank protocol. Vimside uses this same
protocol. Vimside mirrors (only a subset for now) the commands that the 
Emacs Ensime client supports ranging from editing, to building, to
running and, finally, to debugging.

Since, Vimside is, at its core, simply a Vim plugin, one can mix-and-match
other Vim Scala plugins (snipmate, scale syntax highlighting, etc.) to 
create one's own Scala IDE.

==============================================================================
2. Installation                                               *vimside-install*

There are two basic ways to install Vimside. One is to download the Vimside
code and its dependencies by hand and unzip them in their proper places.
The second approach is to use a Vim plugin manager. 
In either case, for a couple of Vimside's dependencies additional steps,
outlined below, are needed.

2.1 Download                                                 *vimside-download*

To get the Vimside zip file from vim.org go to
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4298
and download the latest version. Unzip it in your '.vim' or 'vimfiles'
directory.

For the very latest snapshots of Vimside, a zip file can be downloaded
from: https://github.com/megaannum/vimside.

2.2 Dependency                                             v*imside-dependency*

Vimside has a couple of dependencies on other Vim libraries. Some dependencies
are mandatory - Vimside will not work without them, while others are
optional - with them Vimside has extended capabilities.

2.2.1 Mandatory 

Vimside depends upon Vimproc (https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc) for a 
C-language binding to sockets (and, thus to the Ensime server).

Vimshell (https://github.com/Shougo/vimshell) is needed for launching and 
managing communications with the Scala Repl (and, very possibly, the 
launching of the SBT command line in the future).

It is recommended that you get the latest releases of these since they both 
were modified to add some support for capabilities identified while creating 
Vimside. Download them both and unzip them.

For Vimproc, there is an additional step because it includes a C-language 
library. You must compile the library for your machine.  Vimproc comes with 
a number of make-files. Pick the right one and build the library. Since 
Vimside is for Scala programmers, I expect that building a C-library with 
a supplied makefile will not be too challenging :-)

2.2.1 Optional 

Vim has a Forms library, a character-base user interface 'widget' set, and
Vimside has enhanced capabilities and flexibility if the Forms Library is 
installed. The Forms library depends upon the Vim Self library.

The latest version of these can be gotten from github or you can get 
released versions from vim.org:
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4150)
and
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3072)

2.3 Ensime                                                     v*imside-ensime*

Ensime is not a Vim plugin. It is a Scala program. It has to be installed
and built or a pre-build version has to be used. It can be downloaded
from:

    https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime

One can the follow the instructions there and build it. 

I have never done this. Rather, I have downloaded a pre-build bundle. 
One for Scala 2.9 and another for Scala 10.0. These can be found at:

    https://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime/downloads

The Ensime build directory has the following layout using
ensime_2.9.2-0.9.8.1 as an example:

  ensime_2.9.2-0.9.8.1/
    bin/                 
    LICENSE
    elisp/
    lib/                 
    README.md

or ensime_2.10.0-SNAPSHOT-0.9.7:

  ensime_2.10.0-SNAPSHOT-0.9.7/
    bin/  
    elisp/  
    lib/  
    LICENSE  
    README.md

It is important that the value of the 'vimside-scala-version'
Option agrees with the Ensime build version. For
ensime_2.9.2-0.9.8.1 (the default value):

   call owner.Set("vimside-scala-version", "2.9.2")

and for ensime_2.10.0-SNAPSHOT-0.9.7:

   call owner.Set("vimside-scala-version", "2.10.0")

These values can be set in 'data/vimside/options_user.vim'.

In addition, the version of Java ($JAVA_HOME/bin/java -version)
in the window  that runs Vim (or launched GVim) must agree with
the value of the Option 'vimside-java-version'. This Option
has the default value of '1.6' and can be set, again, in
'data/vimside/options_user.vim':

  call owner.Set("vimside-java-version", "1.6")


Having built Ensime or downloaded a pre-built package, you must
set an Option in Vimside so that Vimside can locate the script
used to start the Ensime server. To set a Vimside Option, you
must copy the 'example_options_user.vim' located in
'data/vimside' to a file called 'options_user.vim' and
edit it.

There is two different ways to do this.

The first is to set the Option 'ensime-install-path' to the
location of downloaded Ensime source. If you use the VAM plugin manager,
then Ensime will be in the directory:

  $HOME . "/.vim/vim-addons/ensime
or
  $HOME .  "/vimfiles/vim-addons/ensime

so you would set the Option according

  call owner.Set("ensime-install-path", $HOME . "/.vim/vim-addons/ensime")
or
  call owner.Set("ensime-install-path", $HOME .  "/vimfiles/vim-addons/ensime")

Then depending upon the name of the build directory, which is under the
'ensime-install-path' Option value directory location, you would
set the value of the Option 'ensime-dist-dir' to that directory name.
For example:

    call owner.Set("ensime-dist-dir", "ensime_2.9.2-0.9.8.1")
or
    call owner.Set("ensime-dist-dir", "ensime_2.10.0-SNAPSHOT-0.9.7")

Alternatively, you can specify the full path to the ensime distribution
using the Option 'ensime-dist-path'. As an example, if you installed
an Ensime build package in some Scala directory, you might set
the Option as:

    call owner.Set("ensime-dist-path", $HOME .  "/scala/ensime/ensime_2.9.2-0.9.8.1")

If you set the 'ensime-dist-path', it is checked first and if it exists it
is used rather than the 'ensime-install-path' and 'ensime-dist-dir' combination.


2.4 Directory layout                                 *vimside-directory-layout*

After unpacking the {Vimside} directory layout should look like: 
    $HOME/.vim/
      autoload/
        vimside.vim
        vimside/
          " vimside code
      data/
        " data that persists between invocations of a plugin
        vimside/
            " examples, local test Scala/Java source tree
      " and user options file.
      doc/
        vimside.txt
      plugin/
        vimside.vim

The Vim libraries Vimside depends upon will also be installed under
the standard Vim directories.

If you are using the VAM plugin manager, then, of course, the Vimside
code will be under '$HOME/.vim/vim-addons/vimside'. And, the libraries
that Vimside depends upon, if they too are being managed with VAM, they
will also be loacated under the 'vim-addons' directory.

2.5 Plugin Managers                                   *vimside-plugin-managers*

Vim plugin managers make installing and, even more important, managing 
plugin upgrade easy. Well, I think so.

2.5.1 VAM                                                         *vimside-vam*

For more information about vim-addon-manager, see [vim-addon-manager](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager) and [Vim-addon-manager getting started](https://github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-manager/blob/master/doc/vim-addon-manager-getting-started.txt)

In your .vimrc, add self as shown below:

    fun SetupVAM()

      ...

      let g:vim_addon_manager = {}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources = {}

      ....

      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['self'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/self'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['forms'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/forms'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['vimproc'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/Shougo/vimproc'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['vimshell'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/Shougo/vimshell'}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['ensime'] = {"type": "git", "url": "git://github.com/aemoncannon/ensime", "branch" : "scala-2.9"}
      let g:vim_addon_manager.plugin_sources['vimside'] = {'type': 'git', 'url': 'git://github.com/megaannum/vimside'}


      let plugins = [
        \ 'self',
        \ 'forms',
        \ 'vimproc',
        \ 'vimshell',
        \ 'ensime',
        \ 'vimside'
        \ ]

      call vam#ActivateAddons(plugins,{'auto_install' : 0})

      ...

    endf
    call SetupVAM()

Note that to use Vimside, the 'self' and 'forms' libraries above are optional. 
With the 'forms' library, Vimside supports additional features such as a 
popup-menu of commands and the type and package inspectors (not yet 
implemented).

Also, when one downloads Vimproc, you MUST go into the vimproc directory 
and build the C-language file 'proc.c' using one of the supplied make files.

Now start Vim. You will be asked by vim-addon-manager if you would like 
to download and install the plugins.

2.5.2 Pathogen                                               *vimside-pathogen*

I do not use pathogen. An example usage would be welcome.

==============================================================================
3. Test Configure                                      *vimside-test-configure*

Out-of-the-box, just as Vimside is installed, it is possible with a couple
of minor actions to run Vimside against a test project that is part of its
installation code.

To run against test Scala/Java project, first in 'data/vimside' 
directory copy example_options_user.vim to options_user.vim.

  > cd $HOME/.vim/data/vimside
  > /bin/cp example_options_user.vim options_user.vim

Then, in options_user.vim uncomment the following two lines:

   call a:option.Set("test-ensime-file-use", 1)
   call a:option.Set("ensime-config-file-name", "ensime_config.vim")

This tells Vimside to use the test project code and to use the
ensime_config.vim as the source for Ensime Configuration.

One can also run Emacs and enter the command to start Ensime. 
I sometimes do this just to check-out how Emacs-Ensime does something
that I am trying to implement in VimL for Vimside.

The test project has both Java code and Scala code. Some of the code
is correct, but other parts will product compile-time errors.

One can test all of the Vimside commands, key mappings, against the
test project without fearing that one might scramble code in an
existing project.

==============================================================================
4. Running                                                    *vimside-running*

4.1 Project Config

There is a single file to configure Vimside Options under '.vim', 
'data/vimside/options_user.vim'. This is sufficient if you only have
a single project on your machine. But, if you have or plan to have more
than one projects on your machine you might want to have project
specific option configuration files. There are two Options that 
control this.

The first Option is: 'vimside-project-options-enabled' and if 
true (default is false), then Vimside will look for a configuration
file with name given by the second Option: 'vimside-project-options-file-name'.

The default value of the 'vimside-project-options-file-name' Option
is 'options_project.vim'.

While in the 'options_user.vim' file, an Option value is set using
the 'Set' function, e.g,:

  call owner.Set("vimside-scala-version", "2.9.2")

In the 'options_project.vim' file, the Option Update function must be used:

  call owner.Update("vimside-scala-version", "2.10.0")

This is because "Set" can only be called once per-Option (while, 'Update'
can be called any number of times).

So, in the 'options_user.vim' one might have:

  call owner.Set("vimside-scala-version", "2.9.2")
  call owner.Set("ensime-dist-dir", "ensime_2.9.2-0.9.8.1")
  call owner.Set("ensime-config-file-name", "ensime_config.vim")

in a project file there might be:

  call owner.Update("vimside-scala-version", "2.10.0")
  call owner.Update("ensime-dist-dir", "ensime_2.10.0-SNAPSHOT-0.9.7")
  call owner.Update("ensime-config-file-name", "_ensime")



An alternative approach is to also treat the 'data/vimside/' test code
as also a project, in that, it has its own 'options_project.vim' file.
To do this one must do the following:

1) In the 'options_user.vim' file enable project local options files:

    call owner.Set("vimside-project-options-enabled", 1)

While one can also uncomment/add addition option value setting,
if one wants all projects to share some behavior or to set some
default behavior (which can be over-ridden on a project-by-project
basis), but enabling the above Option is all that is need in this file.

2) In the 'data/vimside' directory create a 'options_project.vim' such as:

    " full path to this file
    let s:full_path=expand('<sfile>:p')

    " full path to this file's directory
    let s:full_dir=fnamemodify(s:full_path, ':h')

    function! g:VimsideOptionsProjectLoad(owner)
      let owner = a:owner

      "--------------
      " Enable logging
      call owner.Set("ensime-log-enabled", 1)
      call owner.Set("vimside-log-enabled", 1)
      "--------------

      "--------------
      " Defined Java versions: '1.5', '1.6', '1.7'
      " Defined Scala versions: '2.9.2', '2.10.0'
      " Minor version numbers not needed
      " Scala version MUST match 'ensime-dist-dir' used.
      call owner.Set("vimside-java-version", "1.6")
      call owner.Set("vimside-scala-version", "2.9.2")
      "--------------
      
      "--------------
      " Which build version of Ensime to use. 
      call owner.Set("ensime-dist-dir", "ensime_2.9.2-0.9.8.1")
      "--------------

      "--------------
      " To run against ensime test project code
      " Location of test directory
      call owner.Set("test-ensime-file-dir", s:full_dir)
      " Uncomment to run against demonstration test code
      call owner.Set("test-ensime-file-use", 1)
      " The Ensime Config information is in a file called 'ensime_config.vim'
      call owner.Set("ensime-config-file-name", "ensime_config.vim")
      "--------------

      "--------------
      " Vimside uses Forms library 
      call owner.Set("forms-use", 1)
      "--------------

      "--------------
      " Hover Options
      call owner.Set("vimside-hover-balloon-enabled", 0)
      call owner.Set("vimside-hover-term-balloon-enabled", 0)
      "--------------
    endfunction

This will instruct Vimside to use the "test" source code and configuration
files.

3) In all your other projects on this machine, create their own 
project-specific 'options_project.vim' files.

This is a very flexible way of configuring Vimside.


4.2 Start and Stop

To run Vimside one simply starts Vim and then start the Ensime Server. This
is done by executing the command:

  :call vimside#command#StartEnsime()

There exists a key mapping for this command:

  if has("gui_running")
    nmap <silent> <m-x> :call vimside#command#StartEnsime()<CR>
  else
    nmap <silent> <Leader>vs :call vimside#command#StartEnsime()<CR>
  endif

As with all of the default key mappings, they mirror the Emacs-Ensime
key bindings.  Note that when one is using GVim, the mapping uses
the Meta/Alt key while with Vim, '<Leader>vs' is the mapping.
This is because, there is no reliable, straight forward way of assuring
that everyone on all platforms can actually generate an Meta and/or Alt
key that Vim will receive. At any rate, I could not find such a solution
so I punted.

Vim will display a couple of messages generated by the Ensime server.
When you see the message "Indexer Ready...", then the Ensime server is
ready to accept all commands.

In the 'plugin/vimside.vim' file there is the autocmd 

  augroup VIMSIDE
    au!
    autocmd VimLeave * call vimside#StopEnsime()
  augroup END

that will call the command to stop the Ensime server when you leave Vim
One can also explicitly stop the Ensime server by calling:

  :call vimside#StopEnsime()

which has the key mapping

  nmap <silent> <Leader>vS :call vimside#command#StopEnsime()<CR>

There is no Emacs-Ensime key binding (that I can find) that can be
used to stop the Ensime server from Emacs, hence no key binding to copy.

Sometimes, Vim/Vimside exists without taking down the Ensime Server (its
a background job). This generally only happens if there is some bug in
the Vimside code. If you notice that the Ensime server is still running
after exiting Vim, you can simply kill it.

==============================================================================
5. Options                                                    *vimside-options*

Vimside has many Options, currently, close to 100. The reason for such
a large number of Options is to allow for a flexible architecture and
to allow the user to tailor Vimside. 

Some Options will most likely rarely be modified. For other Options, as the 
user become more familiar with Vimside, they will be modified by the user to 
reflect the user's preferences.  Each Swank RPC Ensime method has both a Vim 
'caller' function and a 'handler' function. The values of the functions 
references are all defined by Options. Also, all Ensime 'notification' Event 
handlers are also defined by Vim function references Options. Under general 
usage, these Options will rarely be changed.

On the other hand, there are Options that are used to control how
information is displayed; in the current window, horizontally or
vertically split the current window or in a new tab; or should Vimside
or the Ensime server log to a file; or whether the Forms library
should be used, etc. These are ultimately up to each user to tailor.

5.1 Dynamic vs Static

Options have two different kinds of scope: 'static' and 'dynamic'.
A 'static' Option is one whose value is determined at the start of a Vimside
session and that value is used throughout the session; it can not be changed.
An example might be the name of the Vimside log file or one of the RPC
'caller' or 'handler' function references. A dynamic Option is one whose
value is requested each time it is needed, allowing a user to tailor
Vimside as it is running. Such a 'dynamic' Option might be how to display
some information: 'same window', 'horizontally split window', 
vertically split window' or 'tab'; or the foreground or background color
of a balloon.

If one brings up the Option Viewer/Editor, there is a Deck with two 
Cards, one Card displaying all of the 'static' Options and the other Card
displaying all of the 'dynamic' Options. As an Editor, it is only the
'dynamic' Options whose values can be change to effect the current
Vimside session.

6. Key Mappings                                              *vimside-mappings*

Vimside has key mappings as short cuts for command execution. It comes
with a set of default mappings which mirror the key bindings that Emacs-Ensime
has. There is also the ability for a user to define their own key mappings
and these will be loaded rather than the default ones. The default key
mappings are in the file 'plugin/vimside.vim' and user-defined key
mappings can be in the file 'data/vimside/plugin_user.vim'. One may
either use one or the other but not both sets of key mappings;
at the top of the default key mapping file, it tests to determine if
a user key mapping file exists and, if it does, then it is sourced
rather than sourcing the rest of the default file.

6.1 Default

The default key mappings located in the file 'plugin/vimside.vim'
mirror the Emacs-Ensime key bindings. What this means is there
is a rough correspondence between the two. For instance, 
Emacs-Ensime uses the key binding:
    C-c C-v . 
to start or expand a syntacic context selection. For Vimside,
    <Leader>v.
is used.

For global search, Emacs-Ensime uses:
    C-c C-v v 
while Vimside uses:
    <Leader>vv

Why do this? Well, whatever mapping is created it is arbitrary
so I just used/morphed the Emacs-Ensime binding.

This 'rule' is not followed or applicable for everything, but it
was a starting point.

6.2 User-Defined

A user is free to create their own key mappings.
To do so, a user must create a file in the 'data/vimside' directory
with the name 'plugin_user.vim'. This file is source and used to
define ALL key mappings if it exists.

While it is expected that the 'plugin/vimside.vim' file which
holds the default key mappings will be over written with each
new Vimside snapshot or version, the user defined 'plugin_user.vim'
is not over written. Thus, rather than have the default plugin
file be used also hold user define mappings, a completely different
file is used (which is NOT over written with each Vimside update).

==============================================================================
7. Features                                                  *vimside-features*

Vimside is based upon Ensime and, as a result, at the core of Vimside
are the capabilities of Ensime. These are reflected in the Ensime
commands supported by Vimside. The full set of Emacs Ensime commands
and key bindings can be found in comments in the Vimside file 
plugin/Vimside.vim. Of those commands, those with Vim key mappings
are also in that file and they, basically, reflect that part of Ensime
that is currently implemented in Vimside. I mirrored the Vim key
mappings to reflect the Emacs-Ensime key bindings but the user is free
to define their own mappings. At the top of the Vimside plugin file
there is code that will source a file called 'plugin_user.vim' located 
in the Vimside 'data' directory: ../data/vimside/plugin_user.vim
instead of the the plugin file if it exists.

7.1 Current Supported Ensime Commands:

The following is the list of Emacs-Ensime commands that have corresponding
implementations in Vimside. Sometimes there is more than one implementation.
This was done to make sure that the Vimside architecture was flexible
enough to allow for extensions. If a command has more than one implementation,
which implementation is executed will depend on the value of an Option.
Some implementations use the Forms library. If the user has not include
the Forms library as a Vim plugin, then such implementations will not
be executed.

7.1.1 Start Ensime

This makes sure that the current environment and Option settings are
correct and then launches the Ensime backend server. The Ensime server
writes a file where it puts the socket port that its client should use.
Vimside reads that file, gets the port number, and provides Ensime
with configuration information.

7.1.2 Stop Ensime

There is also an autocmd that will kill the Ensime server when the 
user exists Vim.

7.1.3 Map <Tab> to Omni-Code Completion

In insert mode, map the <Tab> character so that the Vim OmniCompletion
code is called which, in turn, calls the Vimside/Ensime completion code.

This mapping maybe overridden by the mapping is some other plugin
(like a snipmate binding), So, if it does not seem to work for you
list the current mappings and see what is overriding it.

Very Useful.

7.1.4 Symbol At Point

With cursor on variable, jump to the definition of its symbol.
One can easily jump back and forth.
The Emacs key binding uses the Meta key. In GVim I could get this
to work and so in GVim the key mapping mirrors the Emacs Ensime
key binding. But, with Vim in an XTerm, I could not get the Meta/Alt
key to be recognized (and there is NO single place where there is
a definitive, failsafe guide for getting Meta/Alt key mappings to 
work, so I have a different binding for Vim.

Very useful.

Implementations: 1

7.1.5 Selection Expand/Contract

Select the surrounding syntactic context and easily shrink/grow the
selection.

One implementation uses region group highlight to display the selection
while the other implementation uses the Vim visual mode to do a
visual selection.

Implementations: 2

7.1.6 Global Public Search

Search for method or types through project code using space separated
search terms.

On the command line, the user enters one or more search terms. The
results are displayed in a Vim quickfix window.
If the user types <Esc> the search stops and nothing is displayed.
If the user enter <CR> the search stops and the current search results
are kept.

There are two Options associated with this search. One controls whether or
not the search and display takes place incrementally or only after the 
user enters <CR>.  The other controls whether or not the Vim quickfix
window is displayed if there are not search matches.

Useful.

Implementations: 1

7.1.7 Open Browser Info

With cursor over Scala/Java variable, type, etc. invoke the associated
on-line web api documentation (if it exists).

Useful.

Implementations: 1

7.1.8 Hover To Symbol

Place cursor (or mouse) over a variable and its Symbol will be 
displayed. 

There is a default behavior that shows the information on the command
line. Toggle 'Hover to Symbol' on and place the cursor over a variable.
The symbol information shows up on the command line. Move the cursor
and the information disappears.

For GVim, there is also the Option to use a balloon, like a tool tip,
and the mouse pointer to display a symbols information. The
'vimside-hover-balloon-enabled' Option is used to enable this for GVim
(when GVim is compiled with '+balloon_eval'). Now, it is possible to
change the foreground and background color of the GVim balloon but 
it is far from straight forward and platform dependent, so Vimside does
not have (yet) an Options that support changing the characteristic of a
balloon.

If one is using Vim in an Xterm on Linux (the only platform this was 
tested on), it is possible to juryrig a balloon/tool-tip equivalent.
This requires having three different programs installed:

  xwininfo: Get X window information. On most Linux systems running X.

  xdotool: A command-line X11 automation tool for getting mouse position
    and active window id.  Requires a download/install. On Fedora use Yum.

  dzen2: General-purpose messaging and notification for X11. Used to
  generate 'balloon'.  Requires a download/install. On Fedora use Yum.

Using this approach is enabled with the Option 
'vimside-hover-term-balloon-enabled' (and having the above executables
installed). It is easy to control the foreground and background colors
used in the dzen2 'balloon' so there are Options that can be used to
control that. Fonts can also be set for dzen2, but that is not support
(yet) in Vimside.

Cute but requires frequent server polling.

Implementations: 3

7.1.9 Use of Symbol At Point

List all references to the symbol under the cursor.
With the cursor on a variable, invoke command and references appear in
quickfix windoe.

Very useful.

Implementations: 1

7.1.10 Launch Repl

Switch to the Scala interpreter, with project classes in the classpath.
There is an Option that controls if the Scala Repl appears in 
the 'same window', a 'horizontally split window', a 'vertically split window' or
in a new 'tab'. When the Repl is closed, the previous Vim session is
available.

TBD: cut/paste code fragments into Repl.

7.1.11 Typecheck Current File

Typecheck the current file and display errors and warnings.
Very useful.

Implementations: 1

7.1.12 Typecheck All Files

Typecheck the all files and display errors and warnings.

Very useful.

7.1.13 Re-Show Errors/Warnings

Show all errors and warnings in the project.

Very useful.

Implementations: 1

Implementations: 1

7.1.14 Format Source

Format the current Scala source file.
With this command, it is the Ensime server which formats the file using
the Scalariform preferences defined in one's project's Ensime configuration
file. The formatted file is written to disk by Ensime and Vim is set to
autoload it.

It would be interesting to make the formatter plugable, but for now its
hard-coded.

Useful.

Implementations: 1

7.1.15 Popup Menu

Bring up Popup menu with all Vimside commands (requires Forms library).
The Emacs-Ensime binding has just such a popup menu.

Useful for folks who have not yet learned the key mappings.

Implementations: 1

7.1.16 Browse Source Roots

Directory browser of project sources (project code base).
In the Ensime configuration file, the key ':source-roots' is a list
of the source root directories for a project. These are all of the
project's files to be compiled. This browser lets one move over
the directories and select files to be edited.

There is one implementation that uses "native" Vim and another that
used the Forms library hierarchy and node viewers.

Implementations: 2

7.1.17 Browse Reference Source Roots

Directory browser of project reference sources (Java and Scala libraries).
In the Ensime configuration file, the key ':reference-source-roots' is a list
of the source root directories for a project. These are generally
sources that correspond to library dependencies.
This browser lets one move over the directories and select files to be viewed.

There is one implementation that uses "native" Vim and another that
used the Forms library hierarchy and node viewers.

Implementations: 2

7.1.18 Option Viewer/Editor

Bring up the Option Viewer/Editor (requires Forms library). Lets one
see all of the Vimside configurable Options and their current value.
To be implemented will be an Editor allowing for the modification of
some "dynamic" Options at runtime.

Implementations: 1

7.1.19 Completions

OmmiCompletions using <c-x><c-o>.

This uses Vim's completion mechanism.

Very Useful.

Implementations: 1

7.2 Ensime Capabilities to be Supported:

8. Architecture                                        *vimside-architecture*

This is a brief overview of some of the features of the Vimside architecture.
It differs from most Vim plugins in that it launches and then communicates
with another process, the Ensime server via a socket.

8.1 Client and Server

8.2 Polling, Jobs and Scheduler

Vim is single threaded. 

So, how to get a response from the Ensime server
or how to recieve an asynchronous event from the server? The solution
used by Vimside is 'dynamic' polling of the Ensime socket; the time between 
a poll depends upon if a response or event(s) are expected.

Again, so, how can one poll anything with Vim - its single threaded
and if you are editing a Scala file what does the polling?
Well, there are two mechanisms both involve autocmds: CursorHold(I) and
CursorMoved(I).

The CursorHold autocmd is triggered by the user not having press a key for
a while (the time period is the value of the 'updatetime' option).
Vimside set the value of 'updatetime' depending upon whether or not a
rpc response or event is expected. The that time period ends without
a user key press, then Vimside polls to see if anything is ready to
be read from the Ensime server socket. If something is available,
the appropriate handler is called and, possibly, the value of the
'updatetime' option is adjusted, Whether or not anything is available,
for the CursorHold autocmd to be re-enabled, a key must be pressed.
Vimside mimic such a user action by using the Vim 'feedkeys(chars)' function
so that, again, after the 'updatetime' period, the poll command is 
trigger again (unless the user starts typing which postpones the triggering
of the poll command).

The CursorMoved autocmd is triggered when the cursor is moved. Vimside
does not need to poll the server everytime the cursor is moved so what
is done is that each time CursorMoved is triggered a counter is decremented.
When it reaches zero, it is reset (max_motion_counter) and a poll takes 
place. The value that the counter is reset to depends upon whether a rpc 
response or event is expected from the Ensime server; something is expected, 
the value is small, nothing is expected and the value is large.

A poll will always happen. Either one keeps typing and the CursorMoved 
autocmd is triggered or one stops typing and the CursorHold autocmd
happens. One or the other, eventually.

Now, in reality, this is not exactly what happens. Rather than directly
call the polling action, what happens is a time or motion trigger
function is called and these functions check to see if there are any
jobs registered that are ready to be executed. One such type of job is
the polling of the Ensime server socket, but just about anything can
be scheduled for execution. Some jobs are execute-once while other
jobs are re-registered after each execution and only are stopped by
an explicit de-registration.

Currently, its an art rather than a science to figure out what 
'updatetime' and max_motion_counter values to use for which expected
commands results and event(s). There are some general ranges with
values and on a per-command-basis a means of explicitly setting the values.
All of these are adjustable using appropriate Options.

8.3 Swank Protocol

Communication between Vimside Client and the Ensime server using the Swank 
Protocol. Vimside sends Swank encoded messages to Ensime and Ensime
responds with an ':ok' or ':abort' response and, possibly, some events.

9. FAQ                                                           *vimside-faq*

9.1 User                                                     *vimside-faq-user*
    Q: Why is it call 'Vimside'?
    A: I thought about calling it 'Yasvide' but 'Vimside' is eaier to say.

    Q: What if I find a bug?
    A: Go to https://github.com/megaannum/vimside and enter an "Issue".
       Remember to include Vim, Vimside and Scala versions, Vim or GVim,
       possible Option settings and, if logging was enabled, maybe some 
       of the log output if appropriate.

    Q: How to exit a Vimside
    A: Entering ':q' (or ':q!' to not save work) for each open buffer.

    Q: How to exit a Form in Vimside
    A: Entering <Esc> will exit the current form. If you were in a sub-Form
       you will pop up the its parent Form.

    Q: Why do you have in 'data/vimside' the "example" files: 
       example_options_user.vim, example_options_project.vim
       and example_plugin_user.vim? Why not just options_user.vim, 
       options_project.vim and plugin_user.vim? 
    A: Because everytime you update, the files would be over-written.

    Q: When will Vimside be finished?
    A: Certainly you know the answer, software is never finished.

    Q: When will Vimside enter Alpha?
    A: After all major features (type inspector, package inspector,
       refactoring, build, run, and debug) have some sort of implementation
       so that the Vimside architecture is reasonably stable.

    Q: When will Vimside be feature complete (when will it be in Beta)?
    A: If would be great if Vimside could enter Beta with a solid set of
       unit tests. We will see.

    Q: After a change a file, the "Symbol At Point" command no longer works.
    A: Well, yea. You have to ask Vimside (Ensime) to re-compile the file
       so that it knows 1) where everything is and 2) what everything is.

9.2 Developer                                           *vimside-faq-developer*
    Q: What if I find a bug?
    A: Fix it and submit a patch or go to 
       https://github.com/megaannum/vimside and enter an "Issue".
       Remember to include Vim, Vimside and Scala versions, Vim or GVim,
       possible Option settings and, if logging was enabled, maybe some 
       of the log output if appropriate.

    Q: How to contribute to Vimside?
    A: 1) Give me enough $$ so that I can retire and work on Vimside
       5 days a week (currently, I can only work on it 1 day a week) or
       2) Fork the git project, make extensions/fixes and ask me to
       pull them.

    Q: Why no license?
    A: Vimside is on github meaning that folks can fork-it all they want.
       So, is some additional license needed?
